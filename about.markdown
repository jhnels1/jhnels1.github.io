Hello, I'm Jack - a physicist and data scientist living in Minneapolis, MN. I recently completed my Ph.D. working on the Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search [(SuperCDMS)](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/). My work involves simulating backgrounds and studying sensitive detectors to help experiments search for new and novel models of dark matter. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling with my wife, playing guitar and watching horror films.
