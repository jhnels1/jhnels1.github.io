## Jack H. Nelson
Graduate Research Assistant
University of Minnesota- Twin Cities

### Education

2016 - 2024, *University of Minnesota- Twin Cities*
 - Ph.D. Physics
 - Thesis: Lowering Backgrounds and Thresholds in the Search for Light Dark Matter with SuperCDMS
 
2012 - 2016, *Lewis & Clark College*
 - B.A. Mathematics and Physics, Magna Cum Laude
 
### Experience

2020 - 2024 *University of Minnesota- Twin Cities*, Department of Physics
 - Graduate Research Assistant under Professor Priscilla Cushman
 - Member of the Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search [(SuperCDMS)](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/) collaboration.
 - Generated large volumes of simulation data in Geant4 to study the environmental radiation background for SuperCDMS SNOLAB.
 - Developed pipelines in Python to clean, process and extract features from simulations and model how neutrons penetrate the experimental shielding.
 - Contributed to the design of an auxiliary shield capable of reducing the environmental neutron background for SuperCDMS by up to 90%.
 - Co-led the analysis of a search for light models of dark matter which involved efforts from two scientific collaborations (SuperCDMS and SPICE/HeRALD) and demonstrated world-leading sensitivity (publication forthcoming).
 - Built models using principal component analysis and digital signal processing to classify background events in dark matter search data with high accuracy.

2016 - 2020 *University of Minnesota- Twin Cities*, Department of Physics
