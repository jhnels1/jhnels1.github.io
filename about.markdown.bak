Hello, I'm Jack - a physicist and data scientist living in Minneapolis, MN. I recently completed my Ph.D. working on the Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search [(SuperCDMS)](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/). The focus of my work is simulating backgrounds and studying sensitive detectors in the search for dark matter. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling with my wife, playing guitar and watching horror films.
